# Robotics
It contains the matlab code for
1. Velocity Analysis
2. Finding Jacobian Matrix and Workspace Boundary Conditions

Note: Vab means Velocity of frame a expressed in frame b, Same is valid for Wab(omega), Rab, Tab,etc

The file with .mlx extension is the main program file,
Code line 2 - 5 is used for obtaining Transformation matrix and Rotational matrix using DH Parameters in each main file.
